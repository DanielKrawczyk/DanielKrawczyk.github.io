                                &emsp;My name is <b>Daniel Krawczyk</b>. I am a <span class="colored">Junior Front-End Developer</span> and I started my adventure with programming in 2020. I am not short of ambition, but full of willing to continue learning and develop myself in this direction. 
                                <br />
                                &emsp;Currently I am acquiring knowledge about <span class="colored">noSQL</span> databases and developing my own project on <span class="colored">GitHub</span>, which at the moment offers a playable demo. A second version of this project is also being developed, which will use the Angular framework instead of the React library. In addition, as a hobby, I help with the work on the modification called <span class="colored">Golden Gate</span> to Gothic II (as a level-designer) and learn how to use the Unreal Engine.
                                <br />

                                    &emsp;My interests in IT and computers started from an early age. In the moments of play of cult titles such as Gothic, Morrowind, Heroes III, Stronghold, Anno, Baldur's Gate or Diablo II, I slowly aroused my curiosity and fascination with computers and IT. I used to ask myself "How that games are made?". Years passed, technology was moving forward, and I saw more and more beautiful and advanced wonders. I started to get into computer science harder and harder, until finally curiosity won over reason and after a few months I took my first laptop apart and put in back together. And surprisingly it continued to work!
                                    <br />
                                    &emsp;It did not end with disassembling laptops. I rummaged around the system wherever I could. I looked in awe at every corner where the average user would not be too eager to look. At one point, I also became interested in computer viruses. However, I limited this to YouTube videos. Until I got my hands on more powerful hardware on which I could install <span class="colored">VirtualBox</span> and test various threats in a completely safe and isolated manner. This futher expanded my learning opportunities and I didn't have to worry about breaking something by accident!
                                    <br />
                                    &emsp;I went abroad to work for a vacation in high school. With the money I earned, I bought a laptop, which made me even more attached to computer science. I learned some minor repairs and maintenance, tried my hand at the level-design on the ZenGin Engine, where I am currently helping with the work on the Gothic II add-on called <span class="colored">Golden Gate</span> and took my part in the trial <span class="colored">cybersecurity</span> course.
                                    <br />
                                    &emsp;Eventually, I also got interested in programming. This is how I started a development course that offered <b><a href="http://codehub.pl">CodeHub</a></b>. My enormous ambitions drew me into creating websites and after several months of intensive study, I was able to complete the course and gain the knowledge needed to start a new adventure in my life. I am going to develop and broaden my skills to become a Full Stack Developer in the future!

                                    &emsp;My adventure with programming began in December 2020. I decided to do something that gives me joy and fulfillment, so this is how I started the course for the position of Front End Developer. I additionally bought two books to study. One about HTML and CSS and the other about JavaScript and jQuery. The next few months were full of intense learning. I carried out projects commissioned by mentors, learned both programming and design. I did everything myself, without anyone's help. The last project included the React.js library and its implementation allowed me to receive the coveted <a href="https://codehub.pl/certificates/271/x1JsRQAtlRfB772v"><b>certificate </b></a>, which opened for me the way to a new chapter in my life. After that, I immediately started working on my internet portfolio and started my first project!

                                    &emsp;It started innocently. I saw an announcement on Facebook saying that the second part of the Golden Gate mod is being created for my favorite game, Gothic II, and a level-designer is being sought. I applied and received task to design a simple hunting camp to test my skills. It was my first contact with level design, as well as my first contact with the ZenGin graphics engine. I completed the task in two days. After the design was checked by the expansion team, I was accepted and started by filling in the hunters' camp. I gave free rein to my imagination and created a really atmospheric place. After completing this task, another one was waiting for me - a bandit camp, together with their boss's chamber and the surrounding area. Recently, I have fully completed the camp itself with a chamber, and at the moment I am designing the surrounding areas. Positive feedback from my colleagues motivated me to try something more advanced, which is why I have been learning Unreal Engine 4 for some time. Unfortunately, hardware limitations limit the full use of this engine, but it does not discourage me from further learning!

                                    &emsp;What would the world be without taking a break from reality to plunge into a fantastic land full of adventure. The Gothic series is permanently in my heart. Old Camp and Khorinis were places where I spent most of my time. Added to this are such titles as Heroes of Might and Magic III, IV and V, Stronghold Crusader, all parts of The Elder Scrolls, Anno 1602 and 1404, Diablo II and III, Warcraft, Tzar: The Burden of the Crown, Blizkrieg, Metin, Counter Strike, King's Bounty, Minecraft and Terraria, Fable: The Lost Chapters, Mount & Blade: Warband and Bannerlord, Pillars Of Eternity, Life is strange, Beyond Two Souls, Risen series, all parts of The Witcher, World Of Tanks, War Thunder, Albion Online, Company of Heroes, Call Of Duty, Dead Island and many many more. In addition, on mobile devices I played countless different games, great, good or really bad. I spent the most time on World Of Tanks Blitz due to the lack of access to the computer version. Currently, I play in my spare time between science, portfolio projects and level-design. I often take inspiration from games for D&D campaigns or level design!

                                    &emsp;Great imagination, willingness to write your own fantasy novel, reading books on such subjects. The story with Dungeons & Dragons began long, long ago. And it's not from a board game at all! As a child, I was fascinated by Baldur's Gate II. I remember restarting the game at least 30 times, because there was still something wrong with my character and I wanted to change it. I remember my first contact with the dungeons of Irenicus until today. The passion found its continuation many years later, when I discovered the mobile version of this game as well as other parts and series (Baldur's Gate I, II, Siege of Dragonspear / Icewind Dale / Planescape: Torment / Neverwinter Nights). I became interested in the concept of the Dungeons & Dragons campaign when I saw an exemplary session of the game in the Stranger Things series. This pushed me to buy the starter kit as well as several other manuals and dices. I am currently writing my own campaign and working on a project that uses the rules of the fifth edition of D&D!

                                    &emsp;My first laptop will remember me to the end of its RAM. Taking it apart and putting it back together was a piece of cake for me. And I don't have a single screw left! This hobby really took off when I bought my current laptop. It started out with a simple curiosity. Quick action, unscrew, look, screw. Over time, this curiosity turned into cleaning, replacement of thermal paste or thermopads. I enjoyed taking my laptop apart, doing my own thing, and then reassembling it and seeing the familiar Acer logo on the screen. I cleaned all laptops in my family and felt very satisfied. Added to this was playing with viruses and learning how to eliminate them in VirtualBox, rummaging through the Windows registry editor to a trial cybersecurity course, which I intend to continue as soon as I have the necessary funds!

                                    &emsp;Well, you see. I don’t think there are good or bad situations. If I'd have to remember my life, here with you, I’d say that there were the brief encounters, people that held my hand maybe at a time when I couldn’t or when I was all alone. And it's funny to say that the dangers, the meetings are forging a destiny, because when someone has the taste for it, a taste for the right thing, for the beautiful gestures and sometimes we don't find the other person, well, I'd say, the mirror, who is helping you to progress. Well, it's not my case, as I said, because me, on the contrary, I could and now I say thank you to my life, I code to life, I play games to life, I am only feeling love and finally when many people are asking me nowadays "How do you manage to have this humanity?". Well, I simply reply and tell them that it's the taste of your passions, this taste that pushed me to build a websites today, but tomorrow, who knows, I could be placed in the another programming course and, well... learn... ummm... j-java...
